## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/DrivesQihangZheng.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior at Cornell University majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in aerospace engineering. My project experience has focused on using CAD software to design various structures and mechanisms and rapidly prototyping using 3D printers. My academic experience have allowed me to focus on applying fundamentals of mechanics of materials to analyze structures using simulation software such as ANSYS and Abaqus, as well as hand calculations. Through my experiences, I have developed a deep insterest in the aerospace industry and in particular designing and analyzing structures and mechanisms. Recently I have developed an interest in learning how to perform finite element analysis on structures using simulation software such as ANSYS and Abaqus. I have also developed an interest in mechatronics as it is at the intersection of structures and mechanisms, manufacturing and electronics. I am passionate about being able to design mechanical structures in CAD and being able to create and rapidly prototype ideas using 3D Printing abd basic electronics.
