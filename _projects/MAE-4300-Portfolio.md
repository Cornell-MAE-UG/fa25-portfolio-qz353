This essay is an ethical analysis on the Boeing 737 Max case and focuses on ethical issues regarding the case, and potential ways to resolve the issue to prevent such tragic incident from occurring again in the future. To start off, we will identify some main issues regarding this case. 

- Should FAA have stricter regulations?
- Should pilot have gotten proper training on the MCAS System?
- Should Boeing be prioritizing profits over safety?
- Should Boeing be allowed to self-regulate?

These 5 are the significant issues regarding this case as it closely relates to how Boeing was allowed to self-regulate from loose FAA regulations. This in turn caused them to release the Boeing 737 Max without additional pilot training, MCAS manual, or its faulty testing data in order to commercialize the new aircraft faster before their competitors. These issues focus on the lack of regulations on Boeing and thus causing an aircraft to be released without full proper documentations and training leading to a tragic crash.  

We will first talk abbout the facts of the case. First, we will talk about the technical facts of the case. The MCAS was designed to automatically push the aircraft nose down to stabilize the plane. The MCAS only relied on a single AOA sensor without any redundancy system in place. Boeing did not provide information to the pilots about the MCAS system in the flight manual or training program. AOA sensor malfunctioning on Lion A flight 610 and Ethiopian flight 502 caused erroneous MCAS activation leading to fatal crash. Boeing designed the 737 MAX to handle similar to previous 737 allowing them to avoid costly simulator training for the pilots avoiding regulation.

Next, we will talk about the individual facts of the case. Boeing engineers approved using a single AOA despite internal discussion about adding redundancies. The chief technical pilot lobbied the FAA to remove referencecs to MCAS from pilot training material. Test pilots discovered aggressive MCAS behavior simulator tests but did not escale the issue for redesign. Boeing employees provided misleading information to the FAA by downloading MCAS's power and its activation frequency. FAA inspector delegated safetey certification tasks to Boeing staff rather than conducting independent reviews.

Finally, we will talk about the organizational facts of the case. Boeing's corporate culture prioritized cost reduction and production speed. The FAA's organization designation authorization system allowed Boeing to self-certify much of the aircraft's safety evaluation. Management incentive were tied to product deadlines and sales competition with Airbus, not safety outcomes. Boeing internal communications environment discouraged employees from raising safety concerns or questioning design decisions.The companies strategic goal to rapidly compete with Airbus led to rushed design, certification shortcut, and minimal pilot training. 

Before we can make ethical judgements, we will define key terms that is relevant to analyze this case. These terms have different definitions depending on the party. We will define these in the perspective of the victims of this incident and Boeing.
- Safety
    - Boeing: Meeting regulatory standard and maintaining certification
    - Victims: Reliable and safe travel on flights
    - If safety means simply adhering to certification, it creates an illusion of safety but it should be maintaining certification and constantly testing for reliability.

- Accountability
    - Boeing: Accountability to shareholder and production goals to the public
    - Victim: Boeing being accountable for their failures and rushed production plans.
    - Boeing's definition of accountability prioritizes the stakeholders instead of giving the victims a proper explanation and apologies for their mistake. 

- Reliability
    - Boeing: Meeting technical performance standard under normal conditions.
    - Victims: Having redundant systems and measures in place to ensure operations in all conditions.
    - Boeing's definition of reliablity does not account for emergency conditions while the victims want to be ensured that they are safe under all situations even in emergencies with countermeasures.

- Integrity 
    - Boeing: Upholding formal complicance processes and maintaining corporation reputation
    - Victims: Company being transparent and responsible for their mistake.

After understanding the full situations of the case, we will perform an ethical analysis on the various issues posed in the beginning. We will use the ASME Canons as our standard on the position of Boeing in these issue.
- For the first issue, ASME canon 1 conflicts with 7. Boeing did not provide full MCAS test results which resulted in a faulty system to go into production that misguided the pilots and FAA. It also conflicts with canon 4 as it prioritizes the company over being transparent to ensure public safety and trust.
- For the second issue, ASME canon 1 conflicts with 2. Due to Boeing's competition with Airbus, they didn't release aircraft training in order to speed up production which conflicts with the canons to uphold public safety.
- For the third issue, ASME canon 1 conflicts with 3 because if the engineer stay loyal to the employers, they would not act in interest of safety and welfare of the public.
- For the fourth issue, ASME canon 1 conflicts with 4 because if Boeing is allowed to self-regulate, they would regulate in their own self interest causing them to potentially disregard public welfare for profit.

After analyzing the incident's facts as well as ethical issue of this incident caused by Boeing, we will pose ideal ethical solutions to these issues as well as their constraints. In an ideal situation, FAA shuold maintain full authority and certification to ensure unbiased evaluation. However, due to internal lobbying and pressure, it could prevent them from keeping full control of this process. Boeing should also provide simulator training when introducing a new system and in this case the MCAS system. However, because Boeing wants to speed up production due to competiton pressure, it causes them to release it early without training programs. Boeing Engineers should always prioritize safety and reliability over profit but dut to the market pressure on Boeing, it caused Boeing to omit them from considering redudancy and safety measures. Boeing should not be allowed to self-regulate but due to ambiguous regulations it allowed them to meet minimum requirements. Boeing should also be fully transparent about MCAS and it's training data. However, due to Boeing's company culture, it prevented information that could harm the company be leaked.
