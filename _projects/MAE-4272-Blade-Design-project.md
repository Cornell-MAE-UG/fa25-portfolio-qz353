As apart of our class MAE 4272 - Fluids and Heat Transfer Laboratory, we were tasked to design a small scale wind turbine blade that will maximize power under the conditions in the wind tunnel. Instead of designing for specific wind speeds, our wind turbine is expected to operate at a constant optimal RPM across various wind speed where the environment will be characterize by a Weibull distribution. Our blade geometry must be able to perform across most wind ranges characterized by the Weibull distribution and this requires us to characterize the chord and pitch along our blade properly. The key constraints on the geometry of our blade is that it must have a maximum span of 6 inches, and a maximum distance of 2 inches between the windward facing side of the attachment piece to the trailing edge of the blade. The blade must also operate at a chosen optimal RPM that does not exceed 2000 RPM and is designed for safe operation such that it does not exceed the flexural strength of 55 MPA for our blade material Accura 25. 

For our design process, our initial idea was that in order to maximize power, we want to maximize the lift generation of our blade. In order to do that, we want to choose an optimal angle of attack for the blade to operate at such that the airfoil has the maximal lift to drag coefficient ratio. To maintian the angle of attack constant through the entire blade, we will have to adjust the pitch accordingly since the tangential wind speed will increase from root to tip which will change the angle of relative wind. Following this line of thought, we found that the optimum blade without wake rotations equations were exactly what we were looking for as it follows the same idea and is derived from the blade element momentum theory. These are the optimum blade equations that allowed us to determine the angle of relative wind (phi), chord (c), and pitch ($\theta_p$ ): $\varphi = tan^{-1}\frac{2}{3 \lambda_r}$, $c = \frac{8 \pi rsin\varphi}{3BC_l\lambda_r}$, $\theta_p = \phi - \alpha$. Using these equations, we were able to design a blade at a chosen RPM by varying tip speed ratio($\lambda = \frac{\Omega R}{U}$). Our wind velocity remains the same for as we took the average of the Weibull distribution for a wind velocity of 4.8158 $\frac{m}{s}. After we have our geometry, we wanted to calculated the expected power and stress that will be generated by this blade to see which RPM and airfoil maximized power but always stayed within the stress limit of our material. To calculate power, we were able to determine the lift and drag generated by each element and using the total inplane force (torque) multiplied by our angular velocity (RPM) to determine the power. Stress was calculated in a similar way but we use the out of plane force (thrust) at each section multiplied by the distance from root of that section. It was then summed to find the total stress on the blade. For our stress analysis, we primarily focused on the bending stress caused from thrust as it is the stress that will contribute to breaking the most. Under this process, we tested 3 airfoils (NACA 4412, NACA 6412, SG6403) from 1000 RPM to 2000 RPM. In the end we found that NACA 4412 at 1300 RPM stayed within our gemoetric limit while generating the most power theoretically.

For our testing process, we wanted to see if we were able to properly design a blade to be optimal at our chosen RPMs. In order to do that we wanted a Power vs Wind velocity graph for various constant RPMs. However, this was a rather difficult and time consuming task with our equipment because it's difficult to accurately control the torque brake to perfectly maintain the RPM as wind velocity increased but will also take longer with our limited testing time. The approach we decided to go with was to keep the wind velocity constant and increase the torque brake until it stalled. This will allow us to generate a power vs RPM curve at various velocities. Then we will be able interpolate the data points at a single RPM from that graph to get the Power vs Wind velocity graph we want for various RPM. The figure below shows the data that we collected during our testing being the various points and the curve fitted to it to extrapolate data. We can see that we don't have more than 2 curves overlapping at any RPM. This is due to the fact that as we increasing our torque brake current, once the torque is high enough the turbine will reach a breaking point where stalls and will continue slowing down until it stops. We stop collecting data past this point for that particular RPM. From curve fitting our data, we can see that most of our highest RPMS does accor from around 1300 - 1500 RPM. While there was a mistake in our MATLAB code where we forgot to account for the hub radius when calculating tip speed ratio making the turbine not optimal as seen by the rather low power, it was still designed properly to operate at around the optimal RPM we want it to which is a success.

During this design project, I primarily contributed by developing the blade element theory code to allow us to generate the geometry of the blade in MATLAB and analyzing expected power and stress output to properly select the optimal blade design for our group. I was able to use the equations above and run through various airfoil and RPM iteration to choose which one functions the best. I also developed the testing procedure for our blade that will allow us to see if the blade we designed was optimal and what it's power output was from the wind tunnel. While I was the lead for designing the blade, my group members were able to provide ideas and also contributed to discussions in various design assumptions and initial design brainstorming.
